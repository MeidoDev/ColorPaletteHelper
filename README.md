This plugin adds an addional panel whenever the ingame color picker is in use, which provides a better and more precise way to choose the color you want. It also comes with several comfort functions like swapping main and shadow colors, a randomizer and more.

I did not write this plugin, I only added English translations and changed the panel layout a bit so the text would fit.
